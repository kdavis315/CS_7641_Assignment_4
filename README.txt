Assignment 4

Instructions
Go to the github repository for my code: https://github.com/kdavis315/CS_7641_Assignment_4

I used Chad Maron's code for this assignment: https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments/tree/master/assignment4
I modified the environments in that repository to create my own problems.

The output from my runs are included. It can take a while to run all of the experiments but here are the brief instructions:
1. Run the various experiments (can use `python run_experiment.py --all`) It is possible to run one at a time
using --policy, --value, or --q. (Q-learning takes the longest)
2. Plot the results via `python run_experiment.py --plot`
3. The output folder will contain a large amount of output. The report folder contains the main files used for the final report.
